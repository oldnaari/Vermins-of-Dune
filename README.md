# Vermins of Dune

This is a mod over Dune 2000 game, that is designed to feel like a DLC. That means that the creators of this mod want to add content and extend the gameplay while preserving the vanilla feeling as much as possible.

## Features
### Smuggler Overhaul

The current version only overhauls the smuggler faction. They now have new visuals and sounds, unique units, and a superpower. Also, most importantly, smugglers are now playable in skirmish.

### Extending the Campaign

Sure changing the smuggler faction will add some freshness to the missions where they are involved. But for me, this is not enough as one of the goals of this mod is to make the whole campaign replayable. This makes it most challenging as at the same time this mod shouldn't introduce bigger changes so it still can feel vanilla.

This is why we came up with Culture Building, a single type of building that will unlock the ability to produce high-tech units, which can add diverse flavors depending on the faction it belongs to. To make this addition as subtle as possible these buildings can not built instead they can be randomly found during campaign missions.

Currently, only one Culture Building is implemented which is the Monument (Atreides). You can find them in two campaign missions, but be vary, as the Monuments attract Atreides pilgrims who will join the battle on their side.
