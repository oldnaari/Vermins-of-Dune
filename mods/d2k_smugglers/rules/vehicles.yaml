		Description: Decomposes enemy units into resources
	Encyclopedia:
		Description: Scavengers provide resources while being on the battlefield \n\nTheir attack rays decompose enemy units into salvagable bits. Upon suction these bits are either converted to resources (if on full health) or are used to repair the scavenger if it is damaged. \n\nScavengers are very resistant to bullets and high explosives, but vulnerable to missiles and high caliber guns.
